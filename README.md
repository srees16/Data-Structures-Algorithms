# Data-Structures-Algorithms
Consolidated code for all the Data Structures & Algorithms that I had worked while self-learning and practice of the concepts.

Data Structures contained in the repository include:

Array,
Stack,
Queue,
LinkedList,
DoublyLinkedList,
Tree,
Heap,
HashMap,
Trie and
Graph. 
Both for the integer and the object data types was coded.

Algorithms contain basic sorting programs:
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
