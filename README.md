# Data-Structures-Algorithms
All the Data Structures &amp; Algorithms that I had worked as part of self-learning and practice of the concepts.

Data Structures contained in the repository include Array, Stack, Queue, LinkedList, DoublyLinkedList, Tree, Heap, HashMap, Trie and Graph for both integer and object data types.
Algorithms are basic sorting programs.
